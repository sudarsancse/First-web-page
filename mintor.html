                 teaching Choices and Consequences in 
                 Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). 
                 The course is designed at an 
                 introductory level with no formal 
                 prerequisites, and covers a 
                 range of ethical, societal, and policy 
                 implications of computing and information.
